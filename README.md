# Algorithm gym repository

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in Python and/or Java. The goal is to train myself in algorithmic thinking and prepare for both interviews and coding competitions. 

There are three main folders:
- **Daily Coding Problem** which contains solutions to the problems sent by [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).
- **Programming Challenges Book** which contains solutions to the problems in the book [Programming Challenges](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Challenges-Contest-Training-Computer/dp/0387001638) by Steven Skiena.
- **Other Problems** which contains solutions to other problems I have solved.

*Disclaimer*: these are just attempts, they are not necessarily correct or optimal solutions. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
