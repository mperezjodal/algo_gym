# Algorithm gym repository

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in Python and/or Java. The goal is to train myself in algorithmic thinking and prepare for both interviews and coding competitions. 

There are two main folders:
-  <strong>Daily Coding Problem</strong> which contains solutions to the problems sent by [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).
- <strong>Programming Challenges Book</strong> which contains solutions to the problems in the book [Programming Challenges](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Challenges-Contest-Training-Computer/dp/0387001638) by Steven Skiena.
